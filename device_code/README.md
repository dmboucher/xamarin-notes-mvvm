# notes device code
I started this code with a blank Xamarin.Forms app template.  I left the iOS and UWP projects here (for future exploration/development), but all coding and testing has been focused on the Android project.  That said, I will try to only alter code in the common C# project.

Also, since I want to focus on C# for UI generation, I removed the XAML files from the common C# project and replaced them with C# classes.
