# xamarin-notes-mvvm
I'm teaching myself Xamarin and I wanted a playground to mess around with various concepts... hence this repo.

I'm interested in driving the UI with C# instead of XAML and I want to explore SQLite for local device storage.  I'd like to create a Sync Engine infrastructure that will allow devices to work seamlessly when disconnected.  The devices should periodically sync back to an Azure database via Azure API's & functions, storing their data into a central Azure SQL Database.
